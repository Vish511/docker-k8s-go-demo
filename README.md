You're absolutely right! If you're deploying the application to a **Kubernetes cluster** and have configured the **Deployment YAML** properly, Kubernetes will automatically pull the Docker image for you from Docker Hub (or any other container registry) when you apply the deployment. You don’t need to manually pull the Docker image before deploying the application to Kubernetes.

Here's the updated **README** with that clarification:

---

# docker-k8s-go Sample

This repository contains a sample Go application using Docker and Kubernetes. The application is a simple **"Hello World"** program served using **Gorilla Mux** and deployed within Docker containers, managed by Kubernetes.

The Docker image for the application has already been built and pushed to **Docker Hub**, so Kubernetes will automatically pull the image when deploying.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** with Kubernetes enabled (instead of Minikube)
  - Ensure Docker Desktop is installed on your machine.
  - Enable the **Kubernetes** engine in Docker Desktop settings.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

### 1. Install Docker Desktop
- Download and install **Docker Desktop** from the official website:  
  [Docker Desktop Downloads](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- After installation, enable Kubernetes in the Docker Desktop settings:
  - Open Docker Desktop, go to **Settings** > **Kubernetes**, and check **Enable Kubernetes**.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docker-k8s-go.git
cd docker-k8s-go
```

### 3. Apply Kubernetes Configuration

This project includes Kubernetes YAML files for deploying the application. Kubernetes will pull the pre-built Docker image from **Docker Hub** when deploying the app.

First, apply the Kubernetes deployment, service, and ingress configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

### 4. Access the Application

Once the deployment is successful and the ingress is set up, you can access the application via your browser using the **Ingress URL**.

If you're using **Docker Desktop** with the **Kubernetes Ingress Controller**, you can access the app by visiting:

```text
http://localhost:80
```

Or the specific URL defined in the **Ingress** resource.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: For building the "Hello World" web application.
- **Gorilla Mux**: For routing HTTP requests in the Go application.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application and manage its environment.
- **Kubernetes**: To deploy and manage the containerized app locally.
- **Ingress**: For exposing the application and handling HTTP routing in Kubernetes.
